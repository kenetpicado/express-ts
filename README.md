# express-ts

Minimal Express (v5) + TypeScript starter.

## Purpose / Overview

A reusable minimal starter for building REST APIs or small services using Express 5 and TypeScript. It provides a basic project layout, TypeScript configuration, and npm scripts to develop, build, and run the app.

## Requirements

- Node.js (v18+ recommended)
- npm

## Required environment variables

The app reads these environment variables at runtime (add a .env or set them in your environment):

- PORT — Port to run the server on (default: 3000)
- NODE_ENV — Environment mode (development|production)

If you want to load a .env file in development, install `dotenv` and load it from `src/app.ts` (or `src/index.ts` depending on the project entry).

## Quick start

1. Install dependencies

   npm install

2. Create a .env file (optional)

   Example .env:

   PORT=3000
   NODE_ENV=development

3. Run in development (ts-node with watcher)

   npm run dev

4. Build

   npm run build

5. Run built output

   npm start

6. Format source

   npm run format

## Usage

Start the server and open http://localhost:3000 (or your PORT). Example request:

  curl http://localhost:3000/health

(Replace `/health` with any route provided by the app.)

## Project structure

- src/ — TypeScript source (app.ts, routes/)
- dist/ — compiled output (generated by tsc)
- package.json — scripts and dependencies
- tsconfig.json — TypeScript configuration

## Notes

- tsconfig.json is configured with `module: "nodenext"` and `strict: true` and emits declaration files.
