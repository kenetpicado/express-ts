# express-ts

Minimal Express (v5) + TypeScript starter.

## Purpose / Overview

A reusable minimal starter for building REST APIs or small services using Express 5 and TypeScript. It provides a basic project layout, TypeScript configuration, and npm scripts to develop, build, and run the app.

## Requirements

- Node.js (v18+ recommended)
- npm

## Required environment variables

The app reads these environment variables at runtime (add a .env or set them in your environment):

- PORT — Port to run the server on (default: 3000)
- NODE_ENV — Environment mode (development|production)

(If you want to load a .env file in development, install `dotenv` and load it from `src/app.ts`.)

## Setup

1. Install dependencies

   npm install

2. Run in development (ts/node with watch)

   npm run dev

3. Build

   npm run build

4. Run built output

   npm start

5. Format source

   npm run format

## Project structure

- src/ — TypeScript source (app.ts, routes/)
- dist/ — compiled output (generated by tsc)
- package.json — scripts and dependencies
- tsconfig.json — TypeScript configuration

## Notes

- tsconfig.json is configured with `module: "nodenext"` and `strict: true` and emits declaration files.
